  This property defines the step unit for line box heights. A step unit is the
  length of the vertical rhythm, usually the distance from one baseline to the
  next baseline of the body text. Body text should fit into one step unit, and
  taller lines such as headings should have heights of two or more step units.
  Vertical rhythm is created by making heights of all lines an integer multiple
  of the step unit.
